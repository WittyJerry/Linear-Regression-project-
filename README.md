# Linear-Regression-project-
Using Linear regression for predictions

This project aims to answer real life questions and make predictions.

The following table shows, for a sample of towns in Great Britain, the number of lawyers, x, and the number of cars stolen last week, y.
x	12	7	11	19	5	21	3	4	17
y	14	3	21	28	6	43	1	12	30

Questions:

Examine the data and describe the apparent relationship between the variables x and y.

Predict the number of cars that would have been stolen in a town with:
i) 15 lawyers
ii) 50 lawyers

How confident are you in each of your predictions?

Comment on the suggestion that most lawyers are car thieves.
